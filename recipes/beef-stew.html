    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon: This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.</li>
        <li>Beef: Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Seasonings and herbs: This flavorful beef stew is seasoned with salt, black pepper, fresh garlic, white sugar, and fresh thyme.</li>
        <li>Beer: Of course, you'll need a can of dark beer (such as Guinness).</li>
        <li>Vegetables: This chunky Guinness stew features onions, carrots, and celery.</li>
        <li>Tomato paste: Tomato paste adds richness and flavor depth.</li>
        <li>Stock: Use store-bought or homemade broth. You can use chicken or beef stock.</li>
        <li>Mashed potatoes: Mashed potatoes are optional, but they make a great bed for the Guinness stew. Try our top-rated Basic Mashed Potatoes recipe.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Season beef chuck cubes generously with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Turn heat to high under the skillet and sear beef pieces in the hot fat on both sides until browned, about 5 minutes. Place beef in the stew pot with bacon, leaving fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Turn heat down to medium; cook and stir onions in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes; season with a large pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food into the liquid.</li>
        <li>Pour cooking liquid from the skillet into the stew pot. Stir in tomato paste, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and enough chicken broth to cover.</li>
        <li>Bring stew to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine; reduce heat to low and cover pot.</li>
        <li>Simmer stew until beef is fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir stew occasionally and skim fat or foam if desired.</li>
        <li>Remove cover and raise heat to medium-high. Bring stew to a low boil and cook until stew has slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Arrange mashed potatoes in a ring in a serving bowl; ladle stew into the center of the potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
